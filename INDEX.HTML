 <p>1.Micromax IN 2B (Blue, 64 GB)  (4 GB RAM)</p>

<h2>Descreption</h2>
<p>
  The Micromax In 2b may not be a jack of all trades, but it’s good at a few things, which increases its value over competing smartphones. The phone’s back is made of plastic but is practical in terms of design and does not gather fingerprints and smudges. Its display is sufficiently bright and shows decent colours, keeping in mind its entry-level price tag. In terms of hardware, it goes with the basics, but offers a Unisoc T610 SoC, which has only made it to a few smartphones globally. Surprisingly, the processor turned out to be quite the performer, doing well not just in regular use, but also for some budget gaming, which is unheard of in the entry-level smartphone segment. With Android 11 and no third-party apps and bloatware, the software experience was quite smooth. Camera performance was strictly average and the same can be said about video. The 5,000mAh battery easily got me one and half days’ worth of use with some gaming, which is quite good. Charging was a bit too slow with the bundled 10W charger, and it took over 3 hours to complete the charge.

<p>
  The Micromax In 2b may not be a jack of all trades, but it’s good at a few things, which increases its value over competing smartphones. The phone’s back is made of plastic but is practical in terms of design and does not gather fingerprints and smudges. Its display is sufficiently bright and shows decent colours, keeping in mind its entry-level price tag. In terms of hardware, it goes with the basics, but offers a Unisoc T610 SoC, which has only made it to a few smartphones globally. Surprisingly, the processor turned out to be quite the performer, doing well not just in regular use, but also for some budget gaming, which is unheard of in the entry-level smartphone segment. With Android 11 and no third-party apps and bloatware, the software experience was quite smooth. Camera performance was strictly average and the same can be said about video. The 5,000mAh battery easily got me one and half days’ worth of use with some gaming, which is quite good. Charging was a bit too slow with the bundled 10W charger, and it took over 3 hours to complete the charge.

      <h2>Descreption</h2>
      <p>
        The Realme 8s 5G looks nearly identical to the Realme 8 5G. It has a  6.5-inch display with thin bezels on the sides but a slightly thicker chin. The Realme 8s 5G has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. The Realme 8s 5G has a triple camera module which protrudes enough to cause the device to rock when kept on a table.

 

Powering the Realme 8s 5G is the MediaTek Dimensity 810 5G processor, and is paired with  either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. Both variants have 128GB of storage which is expandable using the dedicated microSD card slot. Realme also has a Virtual RAM feature which lets you use 5GB of storage to extend RAM. You get a 5,000mAh battery and a 33W charger in the box. Battery life on the Realme 8s 5G was good, and it can last beyond a day quite easily. Charging the 5,000mAh battery with the supplied 33W Dart Charger got the phone to 94 percent in an hour.

 

Realme 8s 5G has a triple camera setup with a 64-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture, a 2-megapixel B&W portrait camera, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. It managed good photos in daylight but the lack of an ultra-wide angle camera makes it less versatile than some of the competition. Lowlight camera performance was average though Night mode helped improve the output.

<p>Realme 8 Pro is the successor to the Realme 7 Pro and gets a bold design. It is slimmer than its predecessor and comes in flashy colours. The main change on the Realme 8 Pro is the quad-camera setup at the back which houses a 108-megapixel primary camera. The phone is light and easy to hold.

  It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a hole punch for the selfie camera in the top left corner. The display has full-HD+ resolution and an in-display fingerprint scanner. It is also powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G processor, with 6GB or 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage. You get a 4,500mAh battery that is capable of fast charging at 50W.
  
  The camera performance is a hit or miss with the Realme 8 Pro. Daylight photos were average and did not have as much detail. The phone does a good job with portrait shots and the macros too were sharp but limited to 2-megapixels in resolution. Camera performance in low light was decent with better details in nightmode. 
  
  Realme 8 Pro managed to deliver good battery life and lasted for 26 hours and 14 minutes in our HD video loop test. The 50W bundled charger is quick to charge the phone up getting it to 75 percent in 30 minutes. </p>

  <h2>Descreption</h2>
<p>
  The Realme GT Neo 2 is a solid contender as a mid-range gaming smartphone. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 processor offers plenty of raw performance and the phone’s cooling system does a good job of sustaining that performance during long gaming sessions.

  The Neo Green finish of the GT Neo 2 does stand out quite a bit and bright neon green colour can be a bit too much for some buyers. Thankfully, Realme offers two other subtle colourways that also look equally unique.
  
  Battery life with the 5,000mAh battery is excellent and easily lasts a day and half even with some gaming sessions. The dual speakers are quite loud and clear and make for an immersive experience while gaming and are loud enough for watching movies as well.
  
  Camera performance is a mixed bag at best. While daylight performance is good, it's not consistent. Low light camera performance isn’t great and the same can be said about video. And this also means that the GT Neo 2 is not an all-rounder.
